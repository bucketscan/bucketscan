          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            You're spending countless hours every week reviewing and
            managing security measures to protect against malware in user
            uploads. Despite your best efforts, the threat of a breach is
            never far away, and the manual processes are cumbersome,
            error-prone, and inefficient.

            Facing Compliance Headaches?
          </h3>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Navigating the maze of compliance regulations is a nightmare.
            GDPR, HIPAA, SOC-2 â€“ the list goes on. Every upload could be a
            potential compliance violation, leading to hefty fines and a
            tarnished brand reputation. You're caught in a constant battle
            to stay ahead, yet always feel one step behind.
